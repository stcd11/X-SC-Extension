** What are PIC chips?
:PROPERTIES:

:END:
Peripheral Interface Controllers are small silicon chips which can be programmed to perform useful tasks.
In school, we tend to use Genie branded chips, like the C08 model you will use in this project. Others (e.g. PICAXE) are available.
PIC chips allow you connect different inputs (e.g. switches) and outputs (e.g. LEDs, motors and speakers), and to control them using flowcharts.
Chips such as these can be found everywhere in consumer electronic products, from toasters to cars. 

While they might not look like much, there is more computational power in a single PIC chip used in school than there was in the space shuttle that went to the moon in the 60's!
** When would I use a PIC chip?
Imagine you wanted to make a flashing bike light; using an LED and a switch alone, you'd need to manually push and release the button to get the flashing effect. A PIC chip could be programmed to turn the LED off and on once a second.
In a board game, you might want to have an electronic dice to roll numbers from 1 to 6 for you. 
In a car, a circuit is needed to ensure that the airbags only deploy when there is a sudden change in speed, AND the passenger is wearing their seatbelt, AND the front or rear bumper has been struck. PIC chips can carry out their instructions very quickly, performing around 1000 instructions per second - as such, they can react far more quickly than a person can.

- When designing a PIC circuit using a breadboard, you will need to be able to download your program to the PIC to test it.
- To do this, we will need to build an off-board download socket.
- Step one, cut a piece of veroboard, using the 3-in-1 cutter, the board needs to be cut 6 X 8 holes.
- *Make sure you cut the board with the tracks running length ways down.*

- Next, you will need to get the part for the socket, see the picture below.

- Place the components as shown and then solder them. 
- *The 22k resistor is one over from the 100k resistor. Make sure you look carefully at the picture.

- The pinouts are as follows:
- Red = Program
- Blue = Status
- Black = Ground
