** What are PIC chips?
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: research
:END:
Peripheral Interface Controllers are small silicon chips which can be programmed to perform useful tasks.
In school, we tend to use Genie branded chips, like the C08 model you will use in this project. Others (e.g. PICAXE) are available.
PIC chips allow you connect different inputs (e.g. switches) and outputs (e.g. LEDs, motors and speakers), and to control them using flowcharts.
Chips such as these can be found everywhere in consumer electronic products, from toasters to cars. 

While they might not look like much, there is more computational power in a single PIC chip used in school than there was in the space shuttle that went to the moon in the 60's!
** When would I use a PIC chip?
Imagine you wanted to make a flashing bike light; using an LED and a switch alone, you'd need to manually push and release the button to get the flashing effect. A PIC chip could be programmed to turn the LED off and on once a second.
In a board game, you might want to have an electronic dice to roll numbers from 1 to 6 for you. 
In a car, a circuit is needed to ensure that the airbags only deploy when there is a sudden change in speed, AND the passenger is wearing their seatbelt, AND the front or rear bumper has been struck. PIC chips can carry out their instructions very quickly, performing around 1000 instructions per second - as such, they can react far more quickly than a person can.

- *Disclaimer: The project is intended for learning purposes only, do not use in your own devices.*
- You are going to make a headphone splitter inspired by and designed by A. Williams.
** Wiring the input sockets
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: design
:END:
- Below are pictures of how the input sockets are connected.
- *Ensure you are using stereo input sockets.* 
- Ask your teacher to check if you are not sure.

** Building the housing
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: build
:END:
- You will need to laser cut the parts.
- The cutting sheet can be found on the open drive: Design Engineering/Extension tasks/Headphone splitter.
- *You will need to change the black engrave colour to custom blue.*
- Here are all the parts you will need once it is cut out.

[[./img/headphone_splitter3.JPG]]

- The nuts on the end of the inout sockets need undoing and the end caps placed onto the and then the nuts need to be refitted.

[[./img/headphone_splitter4.JPG]]
[[./img/headphone_splitter5.JPG]]

- You need to place a little glue on the side caps and then glue the end pieces in place.

[[./img/headphone_splitter6.JPG]]
[[./img/headphone_splitter7.JPG]]

- Now the 2 sides need gluing in place.

[[./img/headphone_splitter8.JPG]]

- The middle parts need adding and then follow the next few steps.

[[./img/headphone_splitter15.JPG]]

- You now need to push a M3 X 25mm screw through the splitter and tighten a nut on the other side.

- You final headphone splitter will look like this.

- You will need the 3.5mm stereo cables to connect your supposed devices.
